Level 1: Beginner Basics
    - You're learning with super clean, easy-to-use data. Think of it like practicing with perfect toy blocks. You build simple models to see how they work.

Level 2: Real-World Practice
    - Now you're dealing with messy, real-world data, just like in a proper job. You organize your code better, track changes, and make sure your models are tested fairly on unseen data.

Level 3: Ready for Prime Time
    - This is about making your machine learning projects ready to be used by others. You package your code so it can run anywhere (like in a box called Docker), build ways for other programs to talk to your model, and make sure it can handle many users.

Level 4: Big Systems and Scaling Up
    - You're building large, powerful machine learning systems that can handle a lot of data and users. This often involves using cloud computers, automating tasks, and making sure everything runs smoothly and efficiently.

Level 5: Inventing the Future
    - This is where you're creating brand new ways for machine learning to work. You're researching new algorithms, designing new kinds of AI, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the field.
